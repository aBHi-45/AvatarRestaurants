          <p>Many thanks to Carley and her team at Ochre Restaurant for the extraordinary job they did catering for the 2020 Cairns State High School formal at Cairns Cruise liner Terminal with over 280 guests. With the last minute change to the
            venue
            due to COVID19 restrictions, Ochre restaurant took on the job of hosting our event within very tight timelines.
            <br>
            The communication leading up to the event was exceptional. The organisation of the event was excellent and Carley and her team catered for all kinds of dietary requirements without any issue. On the night, the staff were fantastic with
            our
            students and the service was immaculate. I believe there was a major plumbing issue that occurred at the venue, that we did not even know about. I am sure this would have caused much stress for Carley and her team, but handled without any
            problem.
            <br>
            I highly recommend Ochre Restaurant and Catering to any organisation running an event!”
